This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Blog Management (Keystatic)

This project uses [Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/) as a headless CMS for managing blog content.

### Accessing the Admin UI
1. Ensure the development server is running (`npm run dev`).
2. Visit [http://localhost:3000/keystatic](http://localhost:3000/keystatic) (or the port your dev server is running on).

### Workflow
1. **Create/Edit Posts**: Use the visual editor to write your content.
   - **Images**: Drag and drop images directly into the editor.
   - **Custom Blocks**: Type `/` to insert custom components like the `TerminalBlock` for code snippets.
2. **Save Changes**: Clicking "Save" or "Create" will write the content to `content/posts/` (as `.mdoc` files) and images to `public/images/posts/` on your local filesystem.
3. **Commit & Push**: Since content is stored as files, you must commit the changes to git to publish them.
   ```bash
   git add content/posts public/images/posts
   git commit -m "Add new blog post"
   git push
   ```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
