Distributed systems are the backbone of modern software architecture. At the heart of these systems lies the challenge of data replication—ensuring that data is consistently and reliably copied across multiple nodes.

## The Challenge of Consistency

When we talk about replication, we immediately run into the CAP theorem. You can't have it all. Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance—pick two (well, really, pick between C and A in the presence of P).

## Implementing Raft Consensus

One of the most popular algorithms for managing a replicated log is Raft. It's designed to be understandable. Here is how you might verify the status of a Raft node in a production cluster.

{% TerminalBlock
   command="curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/raft/status"
   output="{\n  \"state\": \"Leader\",\n  \"term\": 42,\n  \"commit_index\": 1024,\n  \"applied_index\": 1024,\n  \"peers\": [\"10.0.0.2\", \"10.0.0.3\"]\n}"
   title="terminal" /%}

The output confirms that our node is currently the `Leader` for term 42. All entries up to index 1024 have been committed and applied to the state machine.
